# AI Video Summarizer

## Overview
AI Video Summarizer is an intelligent tool that automatically extracts key information from videos and generates concise summaries. By combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques, this tool helps users quickly understand video content without watching the entire footage.

## Motivation
With the increasing volume of video content across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, educational institutions, and surveillance systems, manually reviewing videos has become time-consuming and inefficient. Our AI-powered video summarization tool addresses this challenge by automatically generating summaries and highlighting important points, saving users valuable time.

## Features
- **Keyframe Extraction**: Identifies and extracts significant frames from videos
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken content into text for analysis
- **Content Analysis**: Identifies important topics and themes in the video
- **Summary Generation**: Creates concise, coherent text summaries of video content
- **Integration of Visual and Textual Information**: Combines both visual cues and spoken content for comprehensive summaries

## Applications
- **Education**: Quick review of lecture videos and instructional materials
- **Security**: Efficient analysis of surveillance footage
- **Entertainment**: Summaries of shows, movies, and livestreams
- **Journalism**: Condensed versions of interviews and reports

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, BERT, GPT
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: Streamlit or React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Version Control**: GitHub
